I work on and with many libraries within the PyData / SciPy ecosystem.

My technical background is in distributed and parallel computing and I apply
that skill set to data science and machine learning.

I wear a lot of hats and have been involved in every step of model development
from initial data exploration to design and implementation of model training and
serving platforms.
